# React Calculator Playground
#### Disclaimer: I am using this repo as a playground as I learn React (as well as improve my web development skills as a whole).  It could possibly be a bit messy and there might be better ways of doing things.  If you come across this repo and have any suggestions whatsoever, I would love to hear them!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running

Run development locally
```
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Tests

```
npm test
```

*Would love to eventually have automated tests.*
